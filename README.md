Isotope eCommerce Archive
=========================

This GIT repository holds outdated Isotope eCommerce extensions as individual branches.
If you are not a developer, you are probably not supposed to use these.


## Extracting an old extension

Extracting an old extension is pretty simple using GitHub.

1. Switch to the branch of the extension you need in the top left corner.
2. Click on "Download ZIP" in the bottom right corner
3. Done!


## Issue handling

The extensions in this repository are no longer maintained.
Therefore, it does not make sense to submit any issues or new feature request.
You can still contact us through the core repository issue system if you think differently.
